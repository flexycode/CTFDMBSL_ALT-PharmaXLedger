[![Next.js 15](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-Next.js%2015-black.svg)](https://nextjs.org/)

PharmaXLedger is a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical supply chain management platform designed to ensure the integrity, transparency, and traceability of life-saving medications. Built with a focus on high-stakes tracking, it bridges the gap between traditional centralized management and future decentralized immutable ledgers.

### Key Capabilities:
- **Manufacturer Hub**: High-detail inventory management and batch registration logic.
- **Logistics Orchestration**: Real-time tracking of custody transfers and shipment progress.
- **Identity Hub**: Secure, glassmorphism-based authentication via Supabase Auth.
- **Digital Ledger**: Every action (Manufacture, Ship, Receive, Dispense) is recorded as a high-integrity transaction.

## 🧬 Digital Provenance & QR Tracking (Phase 1.2)

PharmaXLedger now provides full end-to-end transparency with a integrated digital identity system.

### Traceability Features:
- **Digital Twins**: Unique QR identifiers generated for every drug batch upon registration.
- **Visual Ledger**: An interactive, animated timeline for patients to verify the journey of their medication.
- **Integrity Validation**: Real-time monitoring of the supply chain with cryptographic "Chain-In-Tact" verification.
- **Deep Linking**: Instant access to provenance data via mobile-ready QR codes.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

To enable the full functionality of the Ledger, you must configure your Supabase credentials in a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```env
# Database connection for Prisma
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres?schema=public"

# Supabase Auth & API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that your Supabase roles match the expected `Role` enum in `schema.prisma` (MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR, PHARMACIST, PATIENT) to allow proper routing.

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview


### Phase 1: Robust Centralized Ledger
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Actions)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control (RBAC) via Supabase Auth
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI + Framer Motion for a premium, high-fidelity experience.

### Phase 2: Decentralized Evolution
- **Web3 Integration**: Migrating the ledger to a blockchain (Polygon/Ethereum) for immutability.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated compliance and payment triggers upon verified delivery.
- **DIDs**: Decentralized Identifiers for all stakeholders.

### Phase 3: IoT & AI Sentinel
- **IoT Integration**: Live temperature and location tracking via smart sensors.
- **AI Monitoring**: Predictive analytics for shelf-life and route anomaly detection.

### Phase 4: Global Compliance & Interop
- **GS1 Standards**: Universal pharmaceutical identification compliance.
- **Regulatory Vault**: Automated FDA/EMA compliance reporting.

### Phase 5: Sustainable Ecosystem
- **ESG Ledger**: Tracking carbon footprint of medical logistics.
- **Supply Chain Finance**: Verified delivery proofs unlocking instant liquidity.
